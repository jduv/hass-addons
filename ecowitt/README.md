# Ecowitt

This addon allows you to configure your Ecowitt GW1000/GW1000A device to send data into your Home Assistant instance. Simply use your Home Assistant Server as the 'Customized' weather service in the 'WS View' application.

This is a version of Ecowitt 2 MQTT pre-configured to use Home Assistant MQTT discovery and automatically fetch credentials and connect to the MQTT Addon if installed.
